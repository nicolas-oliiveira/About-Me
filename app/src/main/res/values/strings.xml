    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
    \n\nI love finish.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and swins around ina an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    \nFun fact is that I have several aquariuns and also a river.
    \nnnI like eating fish, too.Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish - not so much.
    \nAnd even less somethings, I actually catch something.
    \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else abbout fishing, thoug.\n\n
